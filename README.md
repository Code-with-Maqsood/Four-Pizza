# **Four Pizza**

**Four Pizza** is a modern and interactive pizza ordering application built with React. This project is a clone of the popular **Fast React Pizza** application, with a personalized twist. It demonstrates my skills in React development, including creating reusable components, state management, and responsive design.

- **Dynamic Menu:** Displays a list of pizzas dynamically rendered through reusable React components.  
- **Cart Management:** Add, remove, and update pizza orders with real-time updates to the cart.  
- **Order Summary:** Showcases the total price and detailed list of selected pizzas.  
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
- **Reusable Components:** Built with modular React components for scalability and maintainability.

## **Inspiration**

This project is inspired by the **Fast React Pizza** app created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). I renamed and adapted the project as **Four Pizza** to reflect my custom implementation and learning experience in React development.
